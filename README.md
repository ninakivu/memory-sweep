Memorize the highlighted squares and remember their positions when gone. Try to outsmart your friends, coworkers and even your boss.

#### How do I play?
Observe the grid as some squares change their color. Then click on the squres you think were highlighted. For each click on a correct square you get 10 points, for each wrong one or missed one, you loose 10.
Watch out!!! Do not click on red squares - or you will loose 20 poins!
Each player will have 60 seconds to play. After each completed round, the level progresses automatically.
