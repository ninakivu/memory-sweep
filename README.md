Try to outsmart your friends, siblings, coworkers or even your boss.

#### How do I play?
When you are really ready to get smarter, click on the Start button. Observe the grid while some squares will change to blue for a little while. Click on the squares that you think were blue. For each click on a correct square you get 1 point, for each wrong one or missed one, you loose 1. 
Each player has 7 clicks per level.
